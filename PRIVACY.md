# Privacy Policy for Chrome Multi-Account Containers

**Last Updated:** February 18, 2026

## 1. Data Collection
**We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data.** 

The "Chrome Multi-Account Containers" extension is designed to be privacy-first. All processing happens locally on your device. We do not have servers, and we do not use third-party analytics scripts (such as Google Analytics).

## 2. Permissions & Usage

To function correctly, the extension requires certain permissions. Here is how they are used:

*   **Read and modify your data on all websites (`<all_urls>`)**: This is strictly used to verify which "Container" a tab belongs to, and to swap authentication cookies accordingly. We do not track your browsing history.
*   **Cookies**: Used to manage separate login sessions for different containers. Cookies are stored locally on your device and are never sent to us.
*   **Storage**: Used to save your container preferences (colors, names, and site assignments) locally in your browser.

## 3. Third-Party Services
This extension does not integrate with any third-party services that track you.

## 4. Contact
The source code for this extension is open source and available for audit at [https://github.com/Credshields/Chrome-Multi-Account-Containers](https://github.com/Credshields/Chrome-Multi-Account-Containers).
